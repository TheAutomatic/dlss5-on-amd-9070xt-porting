# DLSS5@AMD RDNA4

DLSS 5 (DLSSNR) on AMD RX 9070 XT / RDNA 4.

[Simplified Chinese](README.zh-CN.md)

A from-scratch re-implementation of NVIDIA's DLSS 5 neural renderer ("DLSSNR", the 71-block Swin/ViT network shipped in
`nvngx_dlssnr.dll`) for AMD RDNA 4. The network was reverse-engineered block by block and now runs as 38 HIP modules per
architecture (gfx1201 = RX 9070 series, gfx1200 = RX 9060 series) on the HIP 7 runtime that ships with the AMD driver. The
weights are NVIDIA's, extracted from the user's own copy of the DLL; nothing of NVIDIA's is distributed here.

Pipeline in every current package: **the game renders at its (low) render resolution → our network processes that frame →
the host upscaler (FSR) takes it to the display resolution.** Three packages, three ways of getting into that position:

| Package | For | How |
|---|---|---|
| **OptiScaler** (regular) | games that expose DLSS (Stellar Blade, Lies of P, …) | OptiScaler answers the game's DLSS call with FSR; our ReShade add-on (`dlss5-amd.addon64`) runs the network on the FSR input first |
| **Magpie** (portable) | any game, no upscaler support needed | Magpie captures the game window; the network runs in the FSR3_SR slot of its effect group, then FSR4 fills the screen (optional XeSS frame generation) |
| **OptiScaler-REFramework** (RE9 only) | Resident Evil Requiem, whose command submission the regular route cannot split | TheAutomatic's modified OptiScaler host + our `LmxxfNrRuntime.dll` (matched pair; do not mix with the regular packages) |

**Current release: 0.40 (2026-10-03).** **The default output changed**: all 71 blocks with fast numerics (`DLSS5_SKIP_BLOCKS=` empty, `DLSS5_FAST_NUMERIC=1`), against NVIDIA 44.26 → 47.55 dB and no overall colour shift, about 0.12 / 0.19 ms (900 / 1080) slower per frame; `DLSS5_SKIP_BLOCKS=42,43,46` + `DLSS5_FAST_NUMERIC=0` gives the 0.39 output bit for bit. New: multi pass `DLSS5_MULTI_PASS=1/2/3` (stronger style, about N times the network; F9 cycles it in game, Stellar Blade 2K 57 / 37 / 27 fps), three config files (`default-config.txt` → `custom-config.txt` → `native-game-flags.txt`, environment on top; packages no longer ship your files), and bit-exact speed-ups (LLVM 23 builds of C32/C64, 1080 −0.2 ms or so). Download: [Quark](https://pan.quark.cn/s/d38e0f653c5a) · [Gofile mirror](https://gofile.io/d/moSf7cqf). 0.39: [Quark](https://pan.quark.cn/s/dea9c0ef2f95) · [Gofile mirror](https://gofile.io/d/iqtFTSpS).

**Requirements.** An RDNA 4 GPU (RX 9070 XT tested; RX 9060 kernels included, untested) and an AMD driver that ships
`amdhip64_7.dll` (current release drivers do). No HIP SDK, no Agility SDK, no preview DXC, no Windows Developer Mode. The
add-on takes ≈1.2 GB of VRAM at 900p (0.6 GB weights, 0.3 GB activations; `DLSS5_HIP_MEMORY=1` writes the breakdown to
`logs\native-hip.txt`); if VRAM is exhausted the frame rate drops and does not recover, so keep texture quality at "High" or
below in Stellar Blade.

**Configuration.** Each package ships the repository template as `DLSS5-AMD\default-config.txt` (before 0.40: `native-game-flags.txt`)
([regular](scripts/hip-game-flags.txt), [Magpie](scripts/hip-magpie-flags.txt), [RE9](scripts/hip-re9-flags.txt); keys are explained in
[scripts/CONFIGURATION.md](scripts/CONFIGURATION.md)). The network tier follows the input (an input within 110% of a tier on both axes uses it: 720 up to 1408×792,
900 up to 1760×990, else 1080, so 2K Quality 1707×961 runs at 900; `DLSS5_NETWORK_HEIGHT` forces one). The regular package turns on a lossy *adaptive ViT reuse* by default
(`DLSS5_VIT_ADAPTIVE=1`, keys in [Development/HIP/VIT-REUSE.md](Development/HIP/VIT-REUSE.md); F8 toggles it and EXACT, set 0 for
bit-exact output; Magpie and RE9 ship it off). From 0.32 the RE9 runtime also reads `DLSS5_HIP_*`, `DLSS5_SKIP_BLOCKS`,
`DLSS5_FIT_LARGE` and the related keys from the flags file; host-side options stay in `OptiScaler.ini` `[DlssNr]`.

**Three config files (0.40 and later).** The `DLSS5-AMD` folder can hold three files, read in this order:
`default-config.txt` (the template, shipped by the package, overwritten on upgrade) → `custom-config.txt` (your own changes; install and
upgrade never touch it; the package ships `custom-config.template.txt` to copy from) → `native-game-flags.txt` (the old single file; an
existing one keeps working). A later file overrides the same key of an earlier one, keys it does not mention keep the earlier value, and a
missing file is skipped. A `DLSS5_*` system environment variable wins over all three files. Same key twice in one file: the last line
wins. An empty value (`DLSS5_SKIP_BLOCKS=`) overrides the earlier files and means the program's built-in default. So to change one
setting, put just that line into `custom-config.txt`, e.g. `DLSS5_MULTI_PASS=2`. Everything that reads settings (regular and Magpie
add-on, hot reload, RE9 runtime) uses the same merge. Details in [scripts/CONFIGURATION.md](scripts/CONFIGURATION.md).

**Magpie notes.** The `FSR3_SR` item of the bundled effect group *is* the DLSS5 entry (its UI name stays FSR3); keep it at
input size and let the following FSR4 item upscale. Use AMD optical flow only on that first item and set Optical Flow Method
to None for FSR4 and XeSS frame generation. `Alt+Shift+A` starts/stops scaling, `F6` toggles the network in every package.

**Per-game notes (regular package).** Titles that ship their own FSR dll next to the executable (REDengine: *Cyberpunk 2077*
2.31; Katana: *Wo Long 2*) need two settings, both verified on Cyberpunk 2077 on 2026-09-24: `OptiScaler.ini` `[Inputs]
EnableFfxInputs=false` (otherwise OptiScaler dispatches FSR through its own detour and the add-on never sees the call) and
`DLSS5_PRE_UPSCALE_ASYNC=0` in `native-game-flags.txt` (their colour buffer is a transient aliased resource; with deferred
submission the add-on copied whatever the memory held at that moment, a sky probe, and the picture only changed in tone).
This needs the add-on from 0.30 or later (hooks the upscaler dll directly and accepts the read-combination resource states
those engines leave behind). Wo Long 2 additionally records draws after the upscaler in the same command list, which the
regular route still rejects. Stellar Blade and Lies of P keep the defaults (`ASYNC=1`). From the 0.30 add-on both of these are
automatic (`DLSS5_PRE_UPSCALE_ASYNC=auto`, `DLSS5_STRENGTH=auto`: per-title table). The strength table gives Cyberpunk 2077
luminance-only transfer (`1,0`): the pre-upscale route hands the network the colour buffer before the game's tone mapper and
LUT, and taking the network's hue there turned green neon ambient brown; luminance-only keeps the detail gain (+19% vs +22%
high-pass energy over plain FSR, measured 2026-09-24) with the game's own colours. Forza Horizon 6 (Xbox app build, tested
2026-09-25): the regular package loads, but like Wo Long 2 the game keeps drawing after the upscaler in the same command list,
so the pre-upscale route gives up on the first frame and passes everything through (F6 does nothing; `native-pre-upscale.txt`
says `UNSAFE: draw/dispatch after deferred upscaler`). Set `DLSS5_PRE_UPSCALE=0` in `native-game-flags.txt` to take the
post-upscale route instead: 2K quality (1508×848 render) about 44 fps, F6 works; the yellow fps overlay does not show. The
next release detects this automatically.

**Where this came from.** 0.15 and earlier ran the network as Direct3D 12 Shader Model 6.10 wave-matrix shaders (now in
`shaders/dx12-network/`, still the bit-exact reference chain). 0.20 moved inference to HIP with bit-identical output and
≈8% less time; 0.22 padded the 900 tier to 960 rows; 0.24 introduced the pre-upscale (render-resolution) path; 0.26.1–0.28.1
built the RE9 host/runtime route with TheAutomatic. Details per version are in the changelog.

**Trading image quality for speed (optional).** All settings below are runtime switches: write them into `custom-config.txt` (the RE9 runtime reads it too), no module swap needed. Turning all of them on gives a "fast mode". **The default is now "all 71 blocks + fast numerics"** (`DLSS5_SKIP_BLOCKS=` empty + `DLSS5_FAST_NUMERIC=1`): compared with the previous default (skip 42,43,46, bit-exact numerics) about 0.12 ms (900) / 0.19 ms (1080) slower per frame, 44.26 → 47.55 dB against NVIDIA, the colour shift is gone, and on motion the error is about 3 dB smaller than with the block skip. Block skip is now an optional speed-up (first row below). The default is still not bit-identical to NVIDIA's network: the fast numerics are lossy and the regular package also enables ViT reuse; for bit-exact output set `DLSS5_FAST_NUMERIC=0` and turn ViT reuse off.

| Setting | What it does | Gain | Quality cost | Deterministic? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DLSS5_SKIP_BLOCKS=42,43,46` (default empty = all 71 blocks; the previous default, now an optional speed-up) | Skips ViT blocks 42, 43 and 46 | About 0.20 ms (900) / 0.32 ms (1080) less per frame | About −3.3 dB against NVIDIA (47.43 → 44.26 dB with bit-exact numerics), plus an overall shift of about +0.15/+0.23 (1/255) (1080p single frame, Style 0) | Yes: structural, per frame, nothing carries over |
| `DLSS5_NETWORK_1080_ROWS=1088` | Runs the 1080 tier on 1088 rows (8 mirrored rows, the geometry Daniel and mochizuki use) instead of 1152 (72 mirrored rows, NVIDIA's geometry) | About 0.45 ms less per frame at the 1080 tier (5.6% less work); 720/900 unaffected | About 54–56 dB against 1152 rows (whole frame); against NVIDIA 47.4 → 45.8 dB (single frame, Style 0, all 71 blocks) | Yes: geometry only, same arithmetic, nothing carries over |
| `DLSS5_NETWORK_HEIGHT=900` (default `auto` picks the tier from the input height) | Runs inputs that would use the 1080 tier on the 900 tier (1600×960) | Offline whole network about 9.5 → 6.8 ms (0.39 timings of the two tiers) | Not measured (no PSNR of 900 vs 1080 or vs NVIDIA) | Yes: geometry, nothing carries over; cost not quantified |
| `DLSS5_FAST_NUMERIC=1` (on in all three templates; `0` = bit-exact) | Fast numeric path: the C32 and C64/C128 window kernels keep activations and normalisation in f32 (dropping the half-precision rounding steps) and compute softmax 1/sum with `rcp`; the host loads the packaged `c32-wave1-fast` / `c64-wave2-fast` modules | Offline about 0.07–0.13 ms (900) and 0.09–0.10 ms (1080) less per frame | Against the bit-exact output 51.8 dB worst frame, 53.1–55.5 dB per sequence; against NVIDIA practically unchanged (block skip 44.26 → 44.23 dB, all 71 blocks 47.43 → 47.55 dB; 1080p single frame, Style 0) | No: numeric approximation, the error passes from layer to layer and can build up. Rounding differences in one block are carried into every later block, and where they surface can't be predicted; nothing carries over between frames |
| `DLSS5_MULTI_PASS_SKIP_BLOCKS=31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47` (default empty; only with `DLSS5_MULTI_PASS=2`/`3`) | Multi-pass skip: the listed blocks are skipped in passes 2 and 3 only; pass 1 always runs the full network. This list = ViT + C512 up; `42,43,46` is the light version | 3 passes, offline: 900 21.1 → 18.4 ms, 1080 29.8 → 25.7 ms (−13%/−14%); `42,43,46` only −0.4/−0.5 ms | Against **our own** 3-pass full-network output (not NVIDIA): this list 34.1–35.0 dB, `42,43,46` 43.9–46.0 dB. For scale, 3 passes vs 1 pass is 35.0 dB: this list takes away much of what the extra passes add (lighter, less contrast), so it is a different look rather than a cheaper 3 passes | Yes: structural, per frame, nothing carries over. The saving is small because the cost is in the full-resolution blocks, which cannot be skipped |
| `DLSS5_VIT_ADAPTIVE=1` (on in the regular package, off in Magpie/RE9) | Adaptive ViT reuse: when the frame changes less than a threshold, the ViT is not recomputed and the last fully computed result is reused. In game F8 toggles between it (AE) and full computation (EXACT); `=0` always computes fully | Offline whole network: moving sequence about 4.9%/6.3% faster at 900/1080, static frames about 9.0%/11.3%; Stellar Blade standing still EXACT 17.9 ms, AE 16.66 ms | A static single frame is bit-identical to EXACT; PSNR on motion against EXACT/NVIDIA not measured | Carries over frames: a result is reused for at most `DLSS5_VIT_REUSE_PERIOD` (default 4) frames. Approximate frames are never written back, so errors do not compound; it resets on recompute, mode switch, geometry change or a gap over 500 ms. Thresholds are heuristic, not guaranteed equivalent in every scene |

**Fast mode** (paste into `custom-config.txt`; `FAST_NUMERIC=1` is already the default, listed for completeness):

```
DLSS5_SKIP_BLOCKS=42,43,46
DLSS5_NETWORK_1080_ROWS=1088
DLSS5_NETWORK_HEIGHT=900
DLSS5_FAST_NUMERIC=1
DLSS5_VIT_ADAPTIVE=1
DLSS5_VIT_REUSE_PERIOD=4
```

With `NETWORK_HEIGHT=900` every input runs on the 900 tier and `1080_ROWS` no longer matters; to keep 1080-tier sharpness, drop the `NETWORK_HEIGHT` line (back to `auto`).

**Multi pass (stronger style, linear cost).** Same idea as Magpie 0.6.8's DLSSNR Multi Pass: the whole network runs N times per frame, each pass fed the previous pass's output picture, so the style gets stronger with every pass. It lives in the network layer shared by all three routes, so regular OptiScaler, Magpie and the RE9 runtime all read the same line:

```
DLSS5_MULTI_PASS=2
```

`1`/`2`/`3`, default `1` (today's single pass, output bit-identical); other values fall back to 1 with a stderr line. Network time grows linearly with the pass count: offline whole network at the 900 tier about 7.0 ms for one pass, 13.7–13.8 ms for 2, 20.4–20.6 ms for 3; at the 1080 tier about 9.8 / 19.5 / 29.0 ms. Against the single pass, 2 passes are about 38.4–39.1 dB and 3 passes about 34.2–34.7 dB (a measure of how much the style moves, not a quality loss). VRAM: one (2 passes) or two (3 passes) extra input buffers, 35.4 MB each at the 1080 tier. Every pass uses the same Style/strength (no per-pass parameters as in Magpie); adaptive ViT reuse is turned off while multi pass is on. Details in `scripts/CONFIGURATION.md` and `Development/results/multi-pass-20261003`.

In game, **F9** cycles 1 → 2 → 3 → 1 passes (regular OptiScaler and Magpie add-on; `DLSS5_MULTI_PASS_HOTKEY` picks another key, `0` turns it off). It writes `DLSS5_MULTI_PASS=N` into `custom-config.txt` and the hot reload switches within about a second, no restart. If `native-game-flags.txt` also has a `DLSS5_MULTI_PASS` line (it would win over custom), that line is changed too. The RE9 runtime has no hot reload: change the file and restart there. To make the later passes cheaper, `DLSS5_MULTI_PASS_SKIP_BLOCKS` skips blocks in passes 2..N only (table above; lossy).

Why only these: the geometry and structure options keep every arithmetic step the same, each frame stands alone and the cost can be measured; ViT reuse works across frames, so its risk is marked separately. The fast numeric path is different: it changes the arithmetic itself, rounding differences travel through all later blocks, and where they surface can't be predicted. The measured cost is small (practically unchanged against NVIDIA), but test frames can't cover every scene, so the current default is explicitly documented as FAST_NUMERIC=1; use 0 to request the reference-oriented arithmetic path. Other lossy options (f16 accumulation, half-precision softmax) are not offered.

## What is in this repository

| Directory | Content |
|---|---|
| `src/` | Standard ReShade add-on, image codecs and game integration; shared by Magpie and regular OptiScaler packages. |
| `hip/` | Shared HIP neural kernels and gfx1200/gfx1201 build recipes for all three packages. |
| `shaders/` | Twelve D3D12 glue shaders every current package still compiles at runtime (codec encode/decode, text overlay, RGB staging, temporal coordinates, frame checks); `shaders/dx12-network/` holds the historical Shader Model 6.10 network chain (0.15 and earlier). See `shaders/README.md`. |

**Source and complete distributions are managed separately.** Git contains our add-on/runtime/HIP sources and RE9 host patches. It does not contain the complete Magpie or regular OptiScaler framework source, or all model/framework assets needed to reproduce the full ZIPs. The RE9 host derives from [TheAutomatic's release/1.9.0](https://github.com/TheAutomatic/dlss-5-amd-project/tree/release/1.9.0); `upstream.json` pins its revision and `prepare-host.py` applies adaptations. Its GPL license is retained separately from this project's MIT code.

On the maintainer's machines, Linux holds this repository; Windows on the RX9070 system holds framework baselines, models and built artifacts. Complete releases are under `D:\給網友打包`; the RE9 host source/output are under `D:\DLSSNR-Lab\re9-presr\source` and `bin`, and HIP experiment artifacts under `D:\DLSSNR-Lab\hip-backend`. These are maintainer paths, not required user installation directories. New releases start from verified ZIPs, not a live game installation.

Integration: **Magpie / regular OptiScaler → dlss5-amd.addon64 → shared HIP kernels**; **RE9-specific OptiScaler → LmxxfNrRuntime.dll → the same HIP kernels**. The RE9 host and runtime must be used as a matched pair.

### Optional Runtime recovery for D3D12 hosts

The standalone `LmxxfNrRuntime.dll` C API in `include/LmxxfNrApi.h` can recover a frame when HIP enqueue fails or the submitted command queue differs from the session queue. Set `LmxxfNrCreateInfo.flags |= LMXXF_NR_CREATE_FLAG_ZERO_OUTPUT_FALLBACK` before `Create`. The default remains strict error reporting.

With this flag, `EnqueueHip` returns `LMXXF_NR_OK` after a verified zero clear of its private neural output; the normal decoder view then uses the original Color. Debug views retain their own display behavior. `GetLastError` contains a recovery diagnostic for that call. The application must submit input and output work on the queue passed to `EnqueueHip`, and submit output-reading work before `Retire`, `Drain`, or `Destroy`. The Runtime waits for the supplied queue before it reuses or frees the output. It cannot discover output readers on other queues; the application must synchronize those queues before reuse or destruction. If clearing fails or completion is uncertain, `EnqueueHip` returns `LMXXF_NR_FAILED`; do not submit output-reading work or reuse the session.

Direct C++ Bridge users may call `D3D12Bridge::ClearOutput(queue)` after submitting the producer and before submitting the consumer. They must drain prior users of the output on other queues before calling it, then drain a different consumer queue before bridge reuse or destruction. The Bridge creates D3D12 zero-clear resources only if this fallback is used. No model weights, shader assets, or HIP modules are changed by this feature.

The C host smoke test is `tools/lmxxf_zero_fallback_abi.c`. On Windows, build the Runtime with `scripts/build-runtime.cmd bin`, then compile the test with `gcc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -I include tools/lmxxf_zero_fallback_abi.c -o bin/lmxxf_zero_fallback_abi.exe` and run it from `bin/`. This checks the exported API table and flag handling without a GPU.

## How it works, briefly

- **Network**: pre-block (C32 @1920×1152) → encoder (C32 ×4, C64 ×4, C128 ×6, C256 ×8, C512 ×8) → 8 global ViT blocks
  (640 tokens × 1024) → decoder (C512 → C32, skip connections) → post-block 70 → RGB head. Window attention on 8×8
  windows, FFN with a 4× hidden layer, the residual stream carried as E4M3 bytes between blocks.
- **Kernels** (`hip/`): every GEMM is an RDNA 4 WMMA 16×16×16 instruction with FP8 (E4M3) or f16 operands and an f32
  accumulator, operands loaded straight from memory or LDS; row reductions (normalisation sums, softmax denominators) are
  WMMAs against an all-ones tile; quantisation uses the hardware FP8 casts. The C32 block runs FFN + attention + projection
  of one 8×8 window in a single 128-thread group with the hidden activations kept in registers; the C64–C256 attention keeps
  its exponentials in registers; weights are prepacked into WMMA fragment order at initialisation. 38 modules per architecture (current source).
- **Game side**: the host hands us the frame at render resolution; the codec (`shaders/native_codec_encode.hlsl`) encodes it onto
  the network surface (fitting any input size to the 720/900/1080 tier, reflected padding), the network runs on a D3D12↔HIP
  shared buffer with fences, and the decode shader composes the result with the original frame (the network steers luminance
  and colour of the full-resolution picture) before the host upscaler sees it. In the pre-upscale (render-resolution) path
  the network's own temporal history is reset every frame and the upscaler does the temporal work; the Magpie path has no
  game motion vectors. An overlay shows the state (`DLSS5 ON 1707x961 -> FSR 2560x1440`, INITIALIZING, UNSUPPORTED).
- **Numerics**: the production fast chain is not a bit-exact NVIDIA oracle. Exact optimisations are checked against an explicit same-source baseline; FAST_NUMERIC, adaptive reuse and third-pass prediction are documented numerical/approximation choices. The 0.36 FMA change also changed the baseline, so not every update since 0.20 was bit-identical.

Current source defaults `DLSS5_MULTI_PASS_PREDICT=1`: 3x uses two real passes and predicts the third (lossy); explicit 0 uses real three passes. 1x/2x are unchanged. F9 changes only the count. Skin defaults to 0. These are upcoming 0.41 source settings, not an update to released 0.40 ZIPs.

## 0.41 local build

**Default 1x.** Selecting 3x defaults to two real passes plus a predicted third (lossy); explicit PREDICT=0 runs real three passes, skin=0. This local package adds the first-frame/device-binding fixes, RE9 strength file control, deeper fast numerics and bit-exact C256/ViT/C512/data-flow improvements. See [0.41 changelog](CHANGELOG.md#041-10-05-built-locally-not-published). Packages are built locally, not uploaded or tagged.

## Building

### Building current HIP sources (after 0.40; 0.41 not released) — where every shipped file comes from

| Shipped file | Source | Build |
|---|---|---|
| `dlss5-amd.addon64` (Magpie / OptiScaler packages) | `src/native_submission_order_probe.cpp` + `src/*.h`, `Development/HIP/*.h` (bridge) | `bash scripts/build-addon-oneclick.sh dlss5-amd.addon64 --hip` on Linux/WSL (fetches MinHook + ReShade 6.8 headers into `third_party/`; needs `g++-mingw-w64-x86-64`). The current script pins the image base and removes PE timestamps; compare with the same compiler/dependencies and validate behaviour |
| `DLSS5-AMD\native-game-tiled-assets\HIP\gfx120{0,1}\*.hsaco` (38 per architecture, 76 total) | `hip/build-modules.ps1` and its source files | Use the mixed-compiler steps below: five LLVM23 modules and 33 COMGR21 modules per architecture; `-RowOpts -PrebuiltDir` reproduces the production recipe |
| the twelve `shaders/*.hlsl` (codec encode/decode, text overlay, RGB staging, temporal coordinates, frame checks) | `shaders/` (the historical DX12 network chain lives in `shaders/dx12-network/`) | copied as source; compiled at runtime by the system `d3dcompiler` (44 variants selected by `#define`s from the host) |
| RE9 package: `dxgi.dll` (modified OptiScaler host) + `LmxxfNrRuntime.dll` | TheAutomatic's fork `release/1.9.0` @ `8f71f73` + our patches in `Development/RE9/presr/` | `python3 Development/RE9/presr/prepare-host.py` (needs the pinned host checkout: `git clone https://github.com/TheAutomatic/dlss-5-amd-project /tmp/re9-upstream-bridge-review && git -C /tmp/re9-upstream-bridge-review checkout 8f71f73`; rewrites the host/runtime sources and copies `src/`, `shaders/`, `hip/` into `third_party/lmxxf/`), then `bash Development/RE9/presr/build-runtime.sh` (MinGW, runtime + smoke test) and `build-host.ps1` on Windows (Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools, MSVC v143 + Windows SDK 10.0.26100; found through vswhere or `-MSBuild <path>`). Without Linux: every RE9 package carries the prepared sources as `sources\re9-presr-source.tar.gz`, so `powershell -File Development\RE9\presr\build-host.ps1 -Root <work dir> -Archive <that tar.gz>` builds the host (`<work dir>\bin\OptiScaler.dll`, shipped as `dxgi.dll`; checked 2026-09-26 from the 0.32 archive on a machine with only the Build Tools: 91 s, same size as the shipped `dxgi.dll`, hash differs by MSVC timestamps).

Packaging currently uses `Development/tools/package-041.ps1` with verified baseline ZIPs, framework and model assets. It assembles local 0.41 packages from verified 0.40 baselines; 0.41 has not been published, and changing its version argument alone is not release validation. `stage-config-layers.ps1` stages defaults without overwriting installed personal settings.

Before release, verify both ELF targets, exports and the 76-module inventory, then the current same-source normal19 (normal/AE/roll), relevant multi-pass and RE9 paths. Lossy switches are explicitly documented. Historical `validate-modules.ps1` and prod6 scripts do not cover every current path.

How the kernel work is organised (for contributors): every optimisation is an experiment under `Development/HIP/experiments/<name>/` (a `prepare.py` that patches the production source into `_pairN` variants or module sets, `build.ps1`, `run.ps1`, sometimes `analyze.py`), with its result written up in `Development/results/<name>-<date>/README.md`; adopted changes become a `HIP_*` flag with the default set in the source. `Development/WorkingPlan.md` says what is being worked on; `Development/DevHistory.md` records what was done and why.

### Current mixed-module build

Linux/WSL needs Python3, MinGW-w64 C++, git/curl. The add-on helper fetches MinHook/ReShade 6.8 headers; pass `--hip` explicitly (its default is historical `--tiled`). Windows module compilation needs PowerShell and the driver's `amd_comgr_3.dll`, without executing GPU work. CPU-host MinGW is separate from the GPU compilers.

LLVM23 prerequisite (Linux; CMake, Ninja and a C/C++ compiler required):

```bash
git clone --depth 1 --branch llvmorg-23.1.2 https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project llvm-src-23
cmake -G Ninja -S llvm-src-23/llvm -B llvm-build-23 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=OFF -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang;lld" -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=AMDGPU -DLLVM_INCLUDE_TESTS=OFF -DLLVM_INCLUDE_BENCHMARKS=OFF -DLLVM_INCLUDE_EXAMPLES=OFF
cmake --build llvm-build-23 --target clang lld llvm-objdump llvm-readobj llvm-dis -j 12
```

Pass the absolute `llvm-build-23/bin` path as `--bin` below. The maintainer's [build-llvm23.sh](Development/tools/llvm-fork/build-llvm23.sh) uses the same settings but hardcodes a local work directory; the commands above do not depend on it.

```bash
bash scripts/build-addon-oneclick.sh dlss5-amd.addon64 --hip
bash scripts/build-runtime.sh bin
x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -static hip/rtc_compile.cpp -o rtc_compile.exe
python3 Development/tools/llvm-fork/compile-modules.py --bin /path/to/llvm-23.1.2/bin --out /path/to/prebuilt --targets gfx1200 gfx1201 --compiler-rows llvm23 --row-opts --target-feature=-real-true16
```

Use an actual public LLVM23.1.2 clang/lld build in `--bin`; the script's default path is the older LLVM21 experiment, **not** LLVM23. See [compiler build notes](Development/tools/llvm-fork/README.md). The prebuild parses the canonical recipe, including its compiler-specific barrier definitions; do not hand-copy a shorter macro list. Copy `rtc_compile.exe`, the repository sources and the entire `prebuilt/gfx1200` and `prebuilt/gfx1201` folders to Windows, then run from the repository root:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File hip\build-modules.ps1 -Compiler .\rtc_compile.exe -OutputDir .\modules -RowOpts -PrebuiltDir C:\build\prebuilt
```

Both targets are the default. LLVM23 rows: `c32-wave1`, `c32-wave1-rtz`, `c32-wave1-fast`, `c64-wave2`, `c64-wave2-fast`. The remaining 33 rows use the driver's COMGR (current validated environment: LLVM21). Omitting `-RowOpts` compiles everything with COMGR and does **not** reproduce the selected production toolchain. `-Only` selects one exact module name; a single `-Targets gfx1201` writes modules directly under OutputDir, while both targets produce architecture subfolders. Keep architecture names when installing/staging. Use current `hip/rtc_compile.cpp`: older helpers could ignore gfx1200; audit ELF targets before release.

A source build alone is not a complete installation: supply matched framework/model/noise assets, the modules plus SHA256SUMS, and `shaders/` beside the DLL. RE9 also needs its matched prepared OptiScaler host (table above). Existing user custom/native values override updated defaults; do not silently replace them. This section documents commands, not a newly built/released package.

### Historical: DX12 editions (up to 0.15)

**None of the following is needed for the current packages** (HIP backend since 0.20: no preview DXC, no Agility SDK, no developer mode). It is kept for the DX12 wave-matrix implementation in `shaders/`, which remains the bit-exact reference chain and the history of the port.

Requirements: Linux / WSL with `x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++` (cross build), Windows with an RDNA 4 GPU and a driver exposing
D3D12 wave matrices (linalg tier 10), the Shader Model 6.10 preview `dxc` (with `dx/linalg.h`), ReShade 6.8 add-on
headers, MinHook sources.

Where the preview pieces come from (all linked from Microsoft's post
[Announcing Agility SDK 1.721 preview and more Shader Model 6.10 features](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/announcing-agilitysdk-721-preview-and-more-shader-model-6-10-features/)):
the preview DXC is a *preview* release of [microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/releases)
(we use v1.10.2605.24, `dxc_preview_2026_05_22.zip`; unzip anywhere and pass the folder as `-DxcRoot`); the Agility SDK
runtime (`D3D12Core.dll`, folder `DLSS5-D3D12-721` in the package) is NuGet `Microsoft.Direct3D.D3D12` 1.721.3-preview;
the AMD driver is the RC "Agility SDK" build 26.10.07.02 (32.0.31007.2048), not a release driver: [download from AMD](https://drivers.amd.com/drivers/amd-software-adrenalin-edition-26.10.07.02-win11-rc7-agility-sdk.exe).
**Windows Developer Mode must be on** (Settings → System → For developers): the add-on enables the experimental shader models with
`D3D12EnableExperimentalFeatures`, which only succeeds in developer mode; without it the initialisation stops at its first step
(`sdk721_before_device ... experimental=` in `logs\native-submission-order.txt` is not `00000000`). Nothing else has to be installed
to run a release package: the shaders are precompiled.

```bash
# one click (Ubuntu / WSL): sudo apt install g++-mingw-w64-x86-64 git; fetches MinHook + ReShade headers into third_party/
bash scripts/build-addon-oneclick.sh            # -> native-game.addon64
# or by hand
bash scripts/build-addon.sh <minhook-src> <reshade-include> native-game.addon64 --tiled
bash scripts/build-bench.sh native-network70-temporal.exe
```

```powershell
# shaders only, any Windows x64 machine (needs the SM 6.10 preview dxc package; no GPU, no weights)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\compile-shaders.ps1 -Folder D:\dlss5-shaders -DxcRoot <dxc-preview>

```

## Changelog

Per-release details (what changed, effect, switches, bit-exactness, experiment folders) are in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

Unless a Magpie scenario is specified, frame rates are Stellar Blade at 1920×1080 on an RX 9070 XT; "bench" is the offline test bench (network only). Every tag
after 0.01 keeps the bit-exact reference chain as its judge (≈ 42 dB PSNR against it); "bit-exact" below means the fast
chain's own output did not change by a single bit.

| Version | Date | What changed | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0.01` | 09-08 | End of the exact port: all 71 blocks on wave-matrix kernels, bit-for-bit equal to the original network for 15 frames; weights resident in VRAM (no per-frame PCIe traffic); scratch shared between blocks (14.7 → 7.3 GB) | bench 186 ms, ~5 fps in game |
| `0.02` | 09-08 | Fast chain begins (exact chain frozen as the judge): FP32 hardware accumulation, E4M3 operands, activation epilogue and attention without intermediate f16 roundings; temporal path (motion vectors + previous output) hooked up in game | bench 112 ms, ~8 fps |
| `0.03` | 09-08 | Hardware f16/E4M3 conversions, fused QKV+normalize, C32 attention in two dispatches, ViT packed inputs, C512 direct attention, FP8 residual stream in the multi-head blocks | bench 62.7 ms, ~15 fps |
| `0.04` | 09-09 | Deferred submission ring, command-list batching (~100 → ~25 lists/frame), C32 attention with QKV folded in, noise prefix generated on the ALU instead of a 200 MB table, ViT QKV fused | game GPU 32 ms, 23–25 fps |
| `0.05` | 09-09 | Output-side temporal smoothing (the rain-scene shimmer), C32 attention two windows per group, ViT attention on FP8 | 24–25 fps |
| `0.06` | 09-09 | Repository restructured (`src/ shaders/ scripts/`), `bench.ps1` flattens the 76 nested runners, per-frame GPU probe off by default (its Flush cost 3 ms), pre-block output as E4M3 | 27–28 fps |
| (0.07) | 09-09 | User package only, no tag: three blocks skipped (40.7 dB), VRAM 6.8 → 3.75 GB with periodic MakeResident, C32 intermediates as f16, post-block merge folded into its FFN | 29 fps |
| `0.08` | 09-10 | C32 FFN fused into the attention prologue; tiled (non-power-of-two stride) layouts for ViT / C512 / decoder-entry weights; C512 FFWD output as E4M3 tiles read directly, C512 blocks mapped to the raster with an E4M3 stream between them (no window pack/crop, no QKV pack); post merge 4 channels per load; decoder projection epilogue with coalesced writes — all bit-exact. Rise of the Ronin via XeSS (`xessD3D12Execute` hook). Profiling toolchain (headless RGP capture, ISA statistics). Black-frame probe. Texture quality "High" or lower is now a stated requirement | bench 24.4 ms, 3.1 GB VRAM, 36–37 fps |
| `0.09` | 09-11 | Upsample projections 56/62/66 write f16 rasters read directly by the next block (bit-exact, −0.2 ms). **Magpie edition**: the add-on now loads in any process (the hard-coded exe whitelist that produced ReShade error 1114 in other games is gone), hooks the FSR 4 SDK loader's `ffxDispatch` as well, accepts 8-bit UNORM textures, scales motion vectors by the dispatch's `motionVectorScale`, and arms on a configurable frame (`DLSS5_SNAPSHOT_FRAME`), so it runs inside the SAOG0721 Magpie fork's FSR3 effect: any game in a 1920×1080 borderless window, no FSR/DLSS support needed (~30 fps; 8-bit sRGB input, so the picture is brighter than the in-game hook). ViT expand+contract fusion tried and rejected (2× slower, latency-bound) | bench ≈24.2 ms, 36–37 fps in game; Magpie ≈30 fps |
| `0.10` | 09-11 | Black-block root cause fixed: the hardware E4M3 cast does not saturate, so a residual beyond ±448 became NaN, the NaN token spread over its 8×8 attention window and the rgb head clamped it to 0. The fused C32 block now clamps to ±448 before its hardware casts (`DLSS5_BUILD_C32_SAT_CAST`, FFN input / hidden / attention input / AV output). Bit-identical on the reference fixture; the Magpie dump frames go from 25920 NaN head values to 0. Windows Developer Mode documented as a requirement (`D3D12EnableExperimentalFeatures`). Magpie bundle `Magpie-DLSS5-AMD-0.10.zip` | unchanged |
| `0.11` | 09-11 | Take-over time 20-30 s → ~3.5 s: weight files prefetched into memory when the add-on loads (`NativePrefetchWeights`), the ~1000 resident weight copies batched into one GPU wait instead of one queue+wait per table (`NativeResidentBatch`; the first version released a copy destination early and hung the GPU — both ends are now held until the flush), the six runtime-compiled shaders cached on disk (`shader-cache\`), f16 weight expansion on 8 threads. Numerically unchanged (reference fixture bit-identical). Init timing probes (`DLSS5_VRAM_LOG=1` / `DLSS5_INIT_LOG=<file>`). Two-pass C32 softmax tried and kept off (null: the 896-byte scratch belonged to a PSO that is never dispatched; the fused kernel has none). Magpie bundle `Magpie-DLSS5-AMD-0.11.zip` | unchanged |
| `0.12` | 09-12 | On-screen notice (`native_text_overlay.h` / `.hlsl`): when the upscaler's output is not 1920×1080 (a 2K/4K screen with Magpie set to fit the screen, or a non-1080p game window) the add-on writes "DLSS5-AMD: INPUT MUST BE 1920X1080 (NOW WxH)" into the picture instead of silently watching; "INITIALIZING..." during the 3-5 s take-over and "INIT FAILED - SEE DLSS5-AMD\LOGS" when initialization fails (developer mode off, wrong driver). A 5×7 bitmap font drawn into our own buffer and copied into the host texture on our own command list after the game's batch (a UAV on the host texture or recording into the game's list crashes D3D12Core in Magpie). `DLSS5_NOTICE=0` in the flags file turns it off. Also: `DLSS5_OVERLAP` (network on its own compute queue, one frame behind; null on this GPU, default off) and `DLSS5_BUILD_C32_LDS_SLIM` (fused C32 kernel with 4 KB less LDS; bit-identical, no gain, default off). Numerically unchanged. Magpie bundle `Magpie-DLSS5-AMD-0.12.zip` | unchanged |
| `0.13` | 09-12 | `DLSS5_SHOW_FPS=1` (on in the Magpie bundle): the network's own frame rate drawn in the corner with the notice font. The hook now takes over the upscaler output in whatever state the game declares for it (mapped ffx_api state bits), not only UAV. Pre-block errors carry the source line. Found the hard way: Windows Update silently replaces the preview driver with the release one (SM 6.10 gone, every PSO fails with E_INVALIDARG, the screen says INIT FAILED) -- reinstall 26.10.07.02 and set `ExcludeWUDriversInQualityUpdate=1`. The Magpie bundle's effect group now has XeSS Frame Generation (ZeroMV, vendor-agnostic) after FSR3_SR: 28 real → 55 presented fps on the 9070 XT, one frame of latency, the network itself ~20% slower next to the optical flow. Numerically unchanged. Magpie bundle `Magpie-DLSS5-AMD-0.13.zip` (sha256 9104C48D…) | unchanged |
| `0.14` (bundle) | 09-12 | FPS display: update at intervals of at least three seconds, reuse the unchanged text strip, and copy it at the end of the existing output submission instead of a separate synchronous submission. XeSS FG ZeroMV remains enabled in the preset. Remove backup DLLs, logs and shader caches from the bundle; regenerate file checksums. `Magpie-DLSS5-AMD-0.14.zip`, 358,004,639 bytes; SHA256 `14ccde3c752b40821cb9f30024579304627a2499e087e06e9aec399bfe734eed`.

User reports better image quality than 720p and steadier frame rates than 1080p with FG. Isolated inference is about 16.71 ms, not game frame time.

Kernel-level work of 09-16/17 (ISA-driven: branchless conversions, batched loads, hoisted reloads, prepacked residual diagonals, inlined prefix) brought the isolated 900p frame from 19.4 to ≈15.5 ms, 8% faster than the DX12 chain; in-game 900p 52 fps.

## Weights

The network weights are NVIDIA's. The runtime weight files the host code loads (`block31-expand.f32`,
`post70-attention.f32`, … about 16 GB with the reference dumps) are not in this repository; they were extracted from a
locally owned copy of `nvngx_dlssnr.dll` with the scripts in `Development/` (`prepare_native_*_gpu.py` and the
per-block notes), which document the layouts but are not a polished pipeline. No NVIDIA DLL is distributed here.

## Authors

Kien — direction, game integration, testing. The reverse engineering, kernels and optimization were
written with AI collaborators (Claude, GPT); the working notes in `Development/` are theirs. Write-ups (Chinese): [WeChat, DLSS5 series](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/mp/appmsgalbum?__biz=MzYzMzMwNzk0NA==&action=getalbum&album_id=4687269655390453762#wechat_redirect).
